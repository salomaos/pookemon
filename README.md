# pookemon
## OOP class project

This is a simple project I made for college, it request data from a Pokemon API and fill a form, so we can check everything and than save it to a database. It also display some info about the pokemons already stored in a graph.

**I made it using Python as the back-end, sqlite3 for database and JavaScript to connect to the API.**
